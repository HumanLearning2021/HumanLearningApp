# Human learning pitch

## Preparation

Do the path in the application at least once before to see if anything crashes.

Predownload an image if the demo is done on an emulator, then add this image during the demo instead of taking one.

## Script

Verbal communication is central to human interaction. This means that if you can't communicate verbally, it is difficult to integrate well into society. People with mental disabilities can have problems communicating verbally, which is why they often use picture-based communication.

But let's say you are little Patrick, and you want an apple. So you give your apple pictogram to Bob, and you receive an apple. But that's not an apple, it's all green, not at all like on the pictogram!

<!-- The problem now is that the same people often do not have good abstraction capabilites. If they show you a picture of a red apple and you give them a green apple, they do not recognize it as being what they requested.-->

A method to teach this abstraction is picture matching, which would traditionally require printing lots of images. With the Human Learning app, you can do all of this digitally, which greatly simplifies the process!

> Start presenting from the app.

After Patrick got frustrated because he didn't receive what he expected, he decides that he wants to improve his understanding of fruits. For this, he clicks on start learning

> click on "START LEARNING!"

he selects the dataset on which he wants to learn

> click on "Fruits"

He can now choose between 3 learning modes. 
Presentation mode allows him to match pictures against an exact copy. This is the easiest mode. 
Representation mode allows him to match pictures against a representative of its category. 
Evaluation mode allows him to evaluate his knowledge of a given dataset.
He chooses representation mode, because he already knows some things about fruits.

> click on "REPRESENTATION"

Now let's say I am an instructor. What I want is to create and manage datasets for my students to learn on. For this, I need administrator privileges, and so need to login as such.

_goes on to login_

_goes to dataset overview, click on dataset to manage_

 _goes in datasets overview, select the good dataset, first add a new picture from the storage, then go check to see if the picture has been added. There is also the picture that should not be in this dataset, delete it._

 Nice, now it is perfect ! My students can go back to learning with the improved dataset.
