# Human learning pitch

## Preparation

Do the path in the application at least once before to see if anything crashes.

Predownload an image if the demo is done on an emulator, then add this image during the demo instead of taking one.

## Script

Verbal communication is central to human interaction. This means that if you can't communicate verbally, it is difficult to integrate well into society. 

> Start video

People with mental disabilities can have problems communicating verbally, which is why they often use picture-based communication.


So let's say you are little Patrick, and you want an apple. 

> Before Patrick shows the apple.

So you show your apple pictogram to Bob, and Bob goes get an apple for you.

> When Patrick is sad

But that's not an apple, it's all green, not at all like on the pictogram!

> When Patrick does picture matching

One way to help little Patrick, is to teach him concept abstraction through picture matching. This is usually done by matching printed pictures, but with Human Learning, you can do all this *digitally*!

### Learner mode

> Start presenting from the app.

After Patrick got frustrated because he didn't receive what he expected, he decides that he wants to improve his understanding of fruits. So he clicks on the fruit dataset on which he wants to learn.

> click on "Fruits"

He can now choose between 3 learning modes to learn at an adapted difficulty.
Let's say he wants to learn in representation mode.

> click on "REPRESENTATION"

He can now match pictures to their representative, and improve his understanding of the concept of fruits.

> match 3 pictures, slowly. 1 right, 1 wrong, 1 right.

### Admin mode

Now let's say I am Bob, and I would like to help little Patrick recognize a new type of apple.

Let me take a picture of this new apple.

> click on [...], then "Add new picture"

I want to use the camera

> click on "USE CAMERA"

I take the picture

> click on "TAKE A PICTURE"

I select the correct category

> click on "SELECT THE CATEGORY", choose "Apple"

And voil√†! Patrick can now learn to recognize this new type of apple.
