# Week 6 sprint retrospective

## Konrad, Jonas Franz
This week I fixed the testing issues on the pr #101 which was that some tests wanted Demo2 to be injected as the dummy database and some as the scratch database. I managed to get the two injections to coexist. This pr was finally merged this week. I also added some methods to the databaseServices and managements as requested by Nicolas. Some housekeeping was done as well (e.g add database rules to the emulator).

## Lachat, Niels Marco
This week I worked on making the learning UI clearer to the learner. I had very little time because I had a lot of work for other courses, so I didn't manage to do the whole task (and I didn't start the other task I was assigned). I addded an issue so I don't forget to finish the work I started in a future sprint. What I managed to do was add a colored border to images in the learning UI, to make it clear what the user should interact with. What still needs to be done is to change the color of the border according to what the learning needs to interact with dynamically. I spent around 6 hours on the project this week (counting reviews). 

## Lenweiter, Martin

## Vial, Nicolas
This week, I worked on improving the dataset management interface to make it more logical and simple to use. I also added the possibility to put a new representative picture with the help of Jonas. Everything went very well for these tasks. There are still one or two graphical details that can be improved but I didn't have time to refine them. I also added a default picture in cases where no representative picture was selected before.
