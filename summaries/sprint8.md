This week I fixed the testing issues on the pr #101 which was that some tests wanted Demo2 to be injected as the dummy database and some as the scratch database. I managed to get the two injections to coexist. This pr was finally merged this week. I also added some methods to the databaseServices and managements as requested by Nicolas. Some housekeeping was done as well (e.g add database rules to the emulator).
