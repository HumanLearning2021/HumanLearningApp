This week I worked on three tasks. First I added image compression to every image that gets added to the database. This drasticly reduced load times with no noticeable quality loss.
Then I fixed a bug where downloading a database where not every category has a representative picture set would crash the app. This was caused by the Room database. I hence improved it in that sense as well as making deletions from it cascade correctly. The last task was some various refactorings and adding kdocs in files from the model.
