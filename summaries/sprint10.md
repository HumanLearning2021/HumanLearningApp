# Sprint 10 retrospective

## Scrum master (Nicolas Vial)


## Bettens, Louis

## Jaakik, Marouane
During this sprint, I have finally managed to merge the required backend changes for User/Admin privileges. I had to discuss a lot with Jonas who helped me to better  understand the Databases Injections and the offline mode to the app, then I figured out how to write more meaningful tests to get the required coverage. I spent 15 hours not including reviews this week going back and forth between on different implementation and test ideas for the backend changes. 

## Konrad, Jonas Franz
This week I added the ability to download the database. This way the app can be used without an internet connection. I also resolved a bug where setting a picture as the representative picture for a category would remove it from storage, hence leading to an inconsistent state in the database. Overall it went ok, some parallelism difficulties where encountered unexpectedly, but I managed to solve them in the end.

## Lachat, Niels Marco

## Lenweiter, Martin
This week I did one the 2 parts of the destabilization sprint (Niels did the other) which consists of an evaluation of a user following the comVoor method. I implemented the UI that displays the result of an evaluation. The main difficulty I had was to get familiar with `MPAndroidChart`, a graph library. I spent about 8 hours of work including reviews.

## Vial, Nicolas
This week, my goal was to fix several minor bugs as well as to improve the user interface so that some interfaces become much more intuitive. I didn't encounter any particular problem and I think the application has become more pleasant and intuitive to use. This week I worked a little bit more than 8 hours with the reviews but I think my time estimation for this week was better than the past weeks.
