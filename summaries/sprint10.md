This week I did one the 2 parts of the destabilization sprint (Niels did the other) which consists of an evaluation of a user following the comVoor method. I implemented the UI that displays the result of an evaluation. The main difficulty I had was to get familiar with `MPAndroidChart`, a graph library. I spent about 8 hours of work including reviews.

## Vial, Nicolas
This week, my goal was to fix several minor bugs as well as to improve the user interface so that some interfaces become much more intuitive. I didn't encounter any particular problem and I think the application has become more pleasant and intuitive to use. This week I worked a little bit more than 8 hours with the reviews but I think my time estimation for this week was better than the past weeks.
