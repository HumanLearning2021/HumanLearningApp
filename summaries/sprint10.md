This week I did one the 2 parts of the destabilization sprint (Niels did the other) which consists of an evaluation of a user following the comVoor method. I implemented the UI that displays the result of an evaluation. The main difficulty I had was to get familiar with `MPAndroidChart`, a graph library. I spent about 8 hours of work including reviews.
