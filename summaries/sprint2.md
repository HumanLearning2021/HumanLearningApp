# Week 1 sprint retrospective

## Scrum master (Konrad, Jonas)
This week we vastly improved on time management in meetings. They were much shorter and a lot more efficient.
We had two short standups (Monday and Thursday) during which everyone updated the group on their current status and their dependencies on work from other people. After the meeting these dependencies where resolved by the concerned parties.
Average meeting duration was 15 minutes.
Pull request were there faster but not entirely reading for merging on Wednesday because of troubles writing the tests.

This week I implemented the AddPictureActivity completely. I had to resolve how this activity would communicate with the rest of the app and how it will return the result (the picture which was taken and the assigned category). This was done using an ActivityResultContract.
I could not find out how to deny permissions during testing. This lead to the 80% test coverage being unachievable and the merge to be impossible due to the CI. I also don't know how to test the aforementioned contract correctly.
