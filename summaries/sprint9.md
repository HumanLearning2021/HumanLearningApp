This week, I integrated the search functionality into our app. This allows to perform a basic search through datasets, which can be done either for learning or dataset editing. It went pretty smoothly, and I spent only 5 hours of work instead of the 8 I had foreseen.

## Vial, Nicolas
This week I made the necessary changes to the interfaces to allow a separation between user and administrator.  There were fewer changes to make than I thought, so I worked a little less than usual this week. My task was dependent on Marouane's who was in charge of the backend, so we communicated a lot to agree on the model used. I thought I would have time to start writing the documentation for all dataset editing interfaces but I didn't find the time. I didn't have any problems except a problem of understanding about injections that Louis helped me to clarify.
