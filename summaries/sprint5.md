During this sprint, I modified all the Dataset Management UIs to use the firestore database. Modifying the activities took some work but I didn't encounter any problems. The problems came when rewriting the tests, I had to familiarize myself with firestore and manage to make the tests work regardless of the state of the database used which took me a lot of time but I finally succeeded. I communicated a lot with Jonas during this sprint and we worked hand in hand to implement all the necessary functions for dataset management. I didn't think it would take me so long, so I couldn't start my 2nd issue which was about modifying the UIs to get a good display no matter the screen size. For the rest, everything went well on my side for this sprint.
