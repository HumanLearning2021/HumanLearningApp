During this sprint I integrated the DatasetListFragment into the DatasetSelectionActivity, so that the user can choose a dataset on which to learn from the available datasets. I also adapted LearningSettingsActivity and LearningActivity to take into account the selected dataset. During the sprint, I traded a task with Martin because otherwise we would have stepped on each other's toes (he was supposed to adapt the learning to be able to use firestore, which I did as part of the adaptations for the dataset selection). Overall it went well I think, with the task taking about 8 hours to do. I'm very excited to see that we are approaching a version of the app where all our work is integrated together!

During this sprint, I modified all the Dataset Management UIs to use the firestore database. Modifying the activities took some work but I didn't encounter any problems. The problems came when rewriting the tests, I had to familiarize myself with firestore and manage to make the tests work regardless of the state of the database used which took me a lot of time but I finally succeeded. I communicated a lot with Jonas during this sprint and we worked hand in hand to implement all the necessary functions for dataset management. I didn't think it would take me so long, so I couldn't start my 2nd issue which was about modifying the UIs to get a good display no matter the screen size. For the rest, everything went well on my side for this sprint.
