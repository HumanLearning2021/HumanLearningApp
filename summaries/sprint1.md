This week I started implementing the activity used to add a picture to a dataset. The activity manages the camera permission and informs the user that it can't use this functionality if it does not give permission to the app to use the camera. The activity also has three buttons ; take the picture, select the category and save. Taking the picture and saving are not yet functional but selecting the category is. I had trouble getting the tests to work but I feel confident that this will go better next week. I also underestimated the time it would take to implement this functionality which means that it will have to be carried over into the next sprint. For next time I mainly need to improve on estimating how long a task will take, this way I will be able to post a pull request earlier which in turn will make the entire process smoother.

This week I desiged the learning UI. At first I had to learn about how to use Constraint Layouts so that the UI adapts well to different screen sizes. I also learned how to do a drag and drop mechanism in android. I think the UI design and the drag feature went quite well. What went wrong is that I underestimated the time to learn about android libraries so I did not have enough time to write the tests and thus be able to merge into main.
